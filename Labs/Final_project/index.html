    <h3>Who are you as a designer?</h3>
    <p>I'm a computer programmer, and visual designer working to build applications that are easy for people to use.
      One of the most important parts for me is the user experience and the ease of use that my designs will have.
      I believe that software should not only be able to be functional, but also easy for the users to use. </p>
    <h3>What's the most importatn thing you want people to take away from viewing your portfolio?</h3>
    <p>The most important thing that i want for people to be able to take away from viewing my portfolio is the ease and cleanness of my designs.</p>
    <h3>What are your three strongest skills?</h3>
    <p>My three strongest skills are creative solutions, designs, and being able to put myself in the users shoes.</p>
    <h3>What are you using for inspiration?</h3>
    <p>Whenever i need to look for something for inspiration i tend to google specific parts that i am working on in my design. 
      Depending on what i am working on i like to look up what other designers have done in order to get ideas of how i can take those ideas and put my own twist on them.</p>
